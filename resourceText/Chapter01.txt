It was just like any other ordinary night...
the sky was clear and one can see the stars shinny beautifully upon the lands.
The moon is ever more round and brighter tonight than usual, giving us a sense of wonder and peace
but something was at foot. A grim fate will fall upon this kingdom. It will never be the same again...
"BOOM! CRASHHHH! HEEEELP!!! SOMEBODY!!! NOOooooo! Let me go!! How.. dar.. yo...."
